# elasticsearch-scroll-and-dump-without-dependencies

A simple python script to scroll over an index and dump it to a file.

This does not rely on the Elasticsearch Python libraries.

For a version of this code that uses the Elasticsearch libraries see: [Elasticsearch scroll and dump](https://github.com/alexander-marquardt/elasticsearch-scroll-and-dump)
